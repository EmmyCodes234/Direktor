# Scrabble Tournament Pairing Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Bye Handling in ScoreEntryModal
**Problem**: Bye matches were not properly setting player IDs and scores.
**Fix**: Enhanced the ScoreEntryModal.jsx to properly handle bye matches:
- Correctly set player IDs for bye matches
- Ensure bye recipients get 100-0 scores
- Properly mark players as receiving a bye in the database

### 2. Forfeit and Withdrawal Functionality
**Problem**: Forfeit and withdrawal matches were not consistently applying scoring rules.
**Fix**: Improved ScoreEntryModal.jsx to ensure consistent scoring:
- Both forfeit and withdrawal now use the same scoring system (0-100 for forfeiting player)
- Properly track which player forfeited/withdrew
- Ensure scores are correctly set before submission

### 3. Pairing Display on Public Tournament Page
**Problem**: New tournaments were not showing pairings on the public page index.
**Fix**: Updated PublicTournamentIndex.jsx to:
- Show pairings even when no results exist yet
- Provide navigation to pairings page from the tournament index
- Handle tournaments with scheduled rounds but no results

### 4. Pairing Schedule Storage and Retrieval
**Problem**: Inconsistencies between dashboard and public pages in displaying pairings.
**Fix**: Enhanced multiple components to ensure consistency:
- TournamentControl.jsx: Improved pairing schedule formatting when saving to database
- PublicTournamentPairings.jsx: Added logic to read pairing_schedule from tournament data
- PairingsTable.jsx: Enhanced display logic to properly show bye pairings
