# Pairings Display Fix - Final Solution

## Problem
The public tournament page was showing "Player 1" vs "Player 2" instead of actual player names in the pairings section.

## Root Cause
The tournament's `pairing_schedule` contained placeholder names like "Player 1", "Player 2" instead of actual player names or IDs. The rendering logic was only checking for `player1_id` and `player2_id` but not handling the pairing_schedule format properly.

## Solution Applied
Updated the player lookup logic in `src/pages/PublicTournamentPage.jsx` (lines ~1057-1075) to:

1. **Check for player IDs first**: If the match data contains `player1_id` and `player2_id`, use those to find actual players
2. **Handle pairing_schedule format**: If the match contains `player1.name` and `player2.name`:
   - For generic names like "Player 1": Map by position to actual players sorted by seed
   - For actual names: Direct name matching
3. **Added comprehensive debugging**: Console logs to help troubleshoot data structure issues

## Key Changes
- Enhanced the `else` block for non-best_of_league tournaments
- Added proper handling for both matches table data and pairing_schedule data
- Improved player lookup by position/seed for placeholder names
- Added detailed debug logging

## Expected Result
The pairings should now display actual player names instead of "Player 1" vs "Player 2".

## Files Modified
- `src/pages/PublicTournamentPage.jsx`

## Testing
Refresh the tournament page and check if player names are now displayed correctly in the pairings section.
