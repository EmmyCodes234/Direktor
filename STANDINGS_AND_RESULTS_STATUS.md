## Photo URL Structure
Based on previous fixes, photos should be stored in the `tournament-photos` bucket and the `photo_url` field should contain the full URL or path to the image.

## Potential Issues to Check

### 1. Photo URL Format
- Verify that `photo_url` contains valid URLs
- Check if photos are accessible from the `tournament-photos` bucket
- Ensure proper CORS settings for image access

### 2. Data Consistency
- Confirm that all tournament pages are using the same data fetching pattern
- Verify that photo URLs are being mapped consistently across components

### 3. Real-time Updates
- Ensure that photo changes are reflected in real-time subscriptions
- Check that new player additions include photo data

## Next Steps
1. Test the current implementation to see if photos are displaying
2. Check browser console for any image loading errors
3. Verify photo URLs are correctly formatted
4. Test real-time updates when player data changes
